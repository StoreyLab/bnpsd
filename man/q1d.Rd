\title{Construct admixture proportion matrix for 1D geography}
\usage{
q1d(n, k, sigma, a = 0.5, b = k + 0.5, s, F, Fst, interval = c(0.1, 10),
  tol = .Machine$double.eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of individuals}

\item{k}{Number of intermediate subpopulations}

\item{sigma}{Spread of intermediate subpopulations (standard deviation of normal densities)}

\item{a}{Location of first individual}

\item{b}{Location of last individual

OPTIONS FOR BIAS COEFFICIENT VERSION}

\item{s}{The desired bias coefficient, which specifies \eqn{\sigma} indirectly.  Required if \code{sigma} is missing}

\item{F}{The length-\eqn{k} vector of inbreeding coefficients (or \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST}'s) of the intermediate subpopulations, up to a scaling factor (which cancels out in calculations).  Required if \code{sigma} is missing}

\item{Fst}{The desired final \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST} of the admixed individuals.  Required if \code{sigma} is missing}

\item{interval}{Restrict the search space of \eqn{\sigma} to this interval}

\item{tol}{The numerical tolerance used to declare the solution found}
}
\value{
If \code{sigma} was provided, the \eqn{n \times k}{n-by-k} admixture proportion matrix \eqn{Q}.  If \code{sigma} is missing, a named list is returned containing \code{Q}, the rescaled \code{F}, and the \code{sigma} that together give the desired \eqn{s} and final \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST} of the admixed individuals.
}
\description{
Assumes \eqn{k} intermediate subpopulations placed along a line at locations \eqn{1:k} spread by random walks, then \eqn{n} individuals sampled equally spaced in \eqn{[a,b]} (default \eqn{[0.5, k+0.5]}) draw their admixture proportions relative to the Normal density that models the random walks of each of these intermediate subpopulations.
The spread of the random walks (the \eqn{\sigma} of the Normal densities) is set to \code{sigma} if not missing, otherwise \eqn{\sigma} is found numerically to give the desired bias coefficient \code{s}, the vector \code{F} of \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST}'s for the intermediate subpopulations up to a scalar factor, and the final \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST} of the admixed individuals (see details below).
}
\details{
When \code{sigma} is missing, the function determines its value using the desired \code{s}, \code{F} up to a scalar factor, and \code{Fst}.
Uniform weights for the final generalized \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST} are assumed.
The scaling factor of the input \code{F} is irrelevant because it cancels out in \code{s}; after \code{sigma} is found, \code{F} is rescaled to give the desired final \eqn{F_{ST}}{FST}.
However, the function stops with a fatal error if the rescaled \code{F} takes on any values greater than 1, which are not allowed since \code{F} are IBD probabilities.

\examples{
## admixture matrix for 1000 individuals drawing alleles from 10 subpops
## and a spread of 2 standard deviations along the 1D geography
Q <- q1d(n=1000, k=10, sigma=2)

## a similar model but with a bias coefficient "s" of exactly 1/2
k <- 10
F <- 1:k # Fst vector for intermediate subpops, up to a factor (will be rescaled below)
Fst <- 0.1 # desired final Fst of admixed individuals
obj <- q1d(n=1000, k=k, s=0.5, F=F, Fst=Fst)
## in this case return value is a named list with three items:
Q <- obj$Q # admixture proportions
F <- obj$F # rescaled Fst vector for intermediate subpops
sigma <- obj$sigma # and the sigma that gives the desired s and final Fst
