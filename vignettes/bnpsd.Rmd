# Introduction

The `bnpsd` package simulates the genotypes of an admixed population.
In the PSD model [@pritchard_inference_2000], admixed individuals draw their alleles with individual-specific probabilities (admixture proportions) from $K$ intermediate subpopulations.
We impose the BN model [@balding_method_1995] to the intermediate subpopulation allele frequency, which thus evolve independently with subpopulation-specific inbreeding coefficients ($\Fst$ values) from a common ancestral population $T$.
The kinship coefficients and generalized $\Fst$ of the admixed individuals were derived in recent work [@Ochoa083915].
A simulated admixed population was used to benchmark kinship and $\Fst$ estimators in the accompanying paper [@Ochoa083923].
Here we briefly summarize the notation and intuition behind the key parameters (see [@Ochoa083915] for precise definitions).

## The BN-PSD population structure

The population structure determines how individuals are related to each other.
The key parameters are the inbreeding coefficients of the intermediate subpopulations ($\ft[S_u]$ below) and the admixture proportions of each individual for each subpopulation ($q_{ju}$), which are treated as fixed variables.

Each intermediate subpopulation $S_u$ ($u \in \{1, ..., K\}$) evolved independently from a shared ancestral population $T$ with an inbreeding coefficient denoted by $\ft[S_u]$.
Each admixed individual $j \in \{1, ..., n\}$ draws each allele from $S_u$ with probability given by the admixture proportion $q_{ju}$ ($\sum_{u=1}^K q_{ju} = 1 \forall j$).
In this case the coancestry coefficients $\theta^T_{jk}$ between individuals $j,k$ (including $j=k$ case) and the $\Fst$ of the admixed individuals are given by:
$$
\theta^T_{jk} = \sum_{u=1}^K q_{ju} q_{ku} \ft[S_u],
\quad \quad
\Fst = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{u=1}^K w_j q_{ju}^2 \ft[S_u],
$$
where $0 < w_j < 1, \sum_{j=1}^n w_j = 1$ are user-defined weights for individuals (default $w_j=\frac{1}{n} \forall j$).
Note $\theta^T_{jk}$ equals the kinship coefficient for $j \ne k$ and the inbreeding coefficient for $j=k$.

The bias coefficient $s$ is defined by
$$
s = \frac{\bar{\theta}^T}{\Fst}
$$
where $\bar{\theta}^T = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n w_j w_k \theta_{jk}^T$.
This $0 < s \le 1$ approximates the proportional bias of $\Fst$ estimators that assume independent subpopulations, and one `bnpsd` function below fits its parameters to yield a desired $s$.

## Random allele frequencies and genotypes

This section details the distributions of the allele frequencies and genotypes of the various populations or individuals of the BN-PSD model.

Every biallelic locus $i$ in the ancestral population $T$ has an ancestral reference allele frequency denoted by $p_i^T$.
By default the `bnpsd` code draws
$$
p_i^T \sim \text{Uniform}(a,b)
$$
with $a=0.01, b=0.5$, but the code accepts $p_i^T$ from arbitrary distributions (see below).

The distribution of the allele frequency at locus $i$ in subpopulation $S_u$, denoted by $p_i^{S_u}$, is the BN distribution:
$$
p_i^{S_u} | T \sim \text{Beta} \left( \nu_s p_i^T, \nu_s \left( 1-p_i^T \right) \right),
$$
where $\nu_s = \frac{1}{\ft[S_u]}-1$.
Allele frequencies for different loci and different subpopulations ($S_u,S_v, u \ne v$) are drawn independently.

Each admixed individual $j$ at each locus $i$ draws alleles from a mixture of Bernoulli distributions from each intermediate subpopulation, which is mathematically equivalent to assigning what we call "individual-specific allele frequencies" (IAFs) $\pi_{ij}$ constructed as:
$$
\pi_{ij} = \sum_{u=1}^K p_i^{S_u} q_{ju}.
$$
The unphased genotype $x_{ij}$ (encoded to count the number of reference alleles) is drawn as:
$$
x_{ij}|\pi_{ij} \sim \text{Binomial}(2, \pi_{ij}).
$$

# Simulation examples

## Population structure: 1D geography

Let's generate the same population structure used in the simulation of [@Ochoa083923].
```{r}
library(RColorBrewer) # for nice colors
# load this package (bnpsd) and a related popgen package (popkin)
# since both packages have an "fst" function, load "bnpsd" last so its function isn't masked
library(popkin) # for visualizing coancestry matrix with plotPopkin
library(bnpsd)

# dimensions of data/model
n <- 100 # number of individuals (NOTE this is 10x less than in publication!)
k <- 10 # number of intermediate subpops

# define population structure
F <- 1:k # subpopulation FST vector, up to a scalar
s <- 0.5 # desired bias coefficient
Fst <- 0.1 # desired FST for the admixed individuals
obj <- q1d(n, k, s=s, F=F, Fst=Fst) # admixture proportions from 1D geography
Q <- obj$Q
F <- obj$F

# get pop structure parameters of the admixed individuals
Theta <- coanc(Q,F) # the coancestry matrix
# verify that we got the desired Fst!
Fst2 <- fst(Q,F)
Fst2
# this should also equal Fst
inbr <- diag(Theta)
popkin::fst(inbr)
# verify that we got the desired s too!
s2 <- mean(Theta)/Fst
s2
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the per-subpopulation inbreeding coefficients (FSTs)
par(mar=c(4,4,0,0)+0.2) # shrink default margins
colIS <- brewer.pal(k, "Paired") # indep. subpop. colors
barplot(F, col=colIS, names.arg=1:k, ylim=c(0,1),
	xlab='Subpopulation', ylab='Inbreeding coeff.')
```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the admixture proportions
par(mar=c(1,4,0,0)+0.2) # shrink default margins
barplot(t(Q), col=colIS, border=NA, space=0, ylab='Admixture prop.')
mtext('Individuals', 1)
```

```{r, fig.width=4.2, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
# Visualize the coancestry matrix using "popkin"!
# set outer margin for axis labels (left and right are non-zero)
par(oma=c(0,1.5,0,3))
# zero inner margin (plus padding) because we have no individual or subpopulation labels
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)+0.2)
# now plot!
plotPopkin(Theta)
```

## Draw random allele frequencies and genotypes

Now let's draw all the random allele frequencies and genotypes from the population structure.
The easiest way is to use `rbnpsd` (the initial `r` is for drawing "random" samples in this and the following functions, in analogy to the `runif`, `rnorm`, `rbeta`, etc. functions from the `stats` R package).

```{r}
m <- 10000 # number of loci in simulation (NOTE this is 30x less than in publication!)
# draw all random Allele Freqs (AFs) and genotypes
# reuse the previous F,Q
out <- rbnpsd(Q, F, m)
X <- out$X # genotypes
P <- out$P # IAFs (individual-specific AFs)
B <- out$B # intermediate AFs
pAnc <- out$Pa # ancestral AFs
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
# inspect distribution of ancestral AFs (~ Uniform(0.01,0.5))
par(mar=c(4,4,0,0)+0.2) # shrink default margins for these figures
hist(pAnc, xlab='Ancestral AF', main='', xlim=c(0,1))
# distribution of intermediate population AFs
# (all subpopulations combined)
# (will be more dispersed toward 0 and 1 than ancestral AFs)
hist(B, xlab='Intermediate Subpopulation AF', main='', xlim=c(0,1))
# distribution of IAFs (admixed individuals)
# (admixture reduces differentiation, so these resemble ancestral AFs a bit more)
hist(P, xlab='Individual-specific AF', main='', xlim=c(0,1))
# genotype distribution of admixed individuals
barplot(table(X), xlab='Genotypes', ylab='Frequency', col='white')
```

Lastly, let's verify that the correlation structure of the genotypes matches the theoretical coancestry matrix we constructed earlier.
For this we use the `popkin` function of the package with the same name.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=2.8, fig.align='center'}
# for best estimates, group individuals into subpopulations using the geography
# this averages more individuals in estimating the minimum kinship
subpops <- ceiling( (1:n)/n*k )
table(subpops) # got k=10 subpops with 100 individuals each
# now estimate kinship using popkin
PhiHat <- popkin(X, subpops)
# replace diagonal with inbreeding coeffs. to match coancestry matrix
ThetaHat <- inbrDiag(PhiHat)

# Visualize the coancestry matrix using "popkin"!
# set outer margin for axis labels (left and right are non-zero)
par(oma=c(0,1.5,0,3))
# increase inner top margin for panel titles
par(mar=c(0,0,2.5,0)+0.2)
# now plot!
x <- list(Theta, ThetaHat)
titles <- c('Truth', 'Estimate')
plotPopkin(x, titles)
```


## Customizing the allele frequency and genotype pipeline

The random variables generated by `rbnpsd` above can also be generated separately using the following functions (where $p$ is the usual variable symbol for allele frequencies):

* `rpanc` (Random $p$ ANCestral)
* `rpint` (Random $p$ INTermediate)
* `rpiaf` (Random $p$ Individual-specific Allele Frequency)
* `rgeno` (Random GENOtypes)

Here is the step-by-step procedure for drawing AFs and genotypes in `rbnpsd`:

```{r}
# reuse the previous m,F,Q
pAnc <- rpanc(m) # draw ancestral AFs
B <- rpint(pAnc, F) # draw intermediate AFs
P <- rpiaf(B, Q) # draw IAFs (individual-specific AFs)
X <- rgeno(P) # draw genotypes
```

We provide functions for these separate steps to allow for more flexibility.
For example, the ancestral allele frequencies could be drawn from a Symmetric Beta:

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
alpha <- 1/2 # this increases rare alleles
pAnc <- rbeta(m, alpha, alpha)
par(mar=c(4,4,0,0)+0.2) # shrink default margins for these figures
hist(pAnc, xlab='Ancestral AF', main='', xlim=c(0,1))
```

You could also draw genotypes from the ancestral population or the intermediate populations:

```{r}
# draw genotypes for one individual from the ancestral population
# use "cbind" to turn the vector pAnc into the column matrix "rgeno" expects
Xanc <- rgeno(cbind(pAnc))
# returns a column matrix:
dim(Xanc)
# draw genotypes from intermediate populations
# draws one individual per intermediate population
Xint <- rgeno(B)
```

## Low-memory genotype simulation algorithm

If you desire to simulate a very large number of individuals ($n$) and loci ($m$), you might run out of memory while running `rbnpsd`.
Memory consumption is reduced by passing the `lowMem=TRUE` option to `rbnpsd`, which draws the genotypes `X` directly from the subpopulation AF matrix `B` and the admixture coefficients `Q`, without storing the whole IAF matrix `P` at any given time.
However, this algorithm is much slower than the default one (`lowMem=FALSE`).

```{r}
out <- rbnpsd(Q, F, m, lowMem=TRUE)
X <- out$X # genotypes
B <- out$B # intermediate AFs
pAnc <- out$Pa # ancestral AFs
# NOTE: out$P is not computed in this mode!
```

The same option exists for `rgeno`, which instead of accepting the IAF matrix `P` as input requires both `B` and `Q` as above:

```{r}
X <- rgeno(B, Q, lowMem=TRUE)
```




# Additional population structures

Here we show examples for functions that create admixture matrices for various simple population structures.
The admixture scenarios implemented in `bnpsd` are generated by functions that start with `q` ($Q$ is the admixture proportions matrix that these functions create):

* `q1d`: (Linear) 1D geography
* `q1dc`: Circular 1D geography
* `qis`: Independent Subpopulations

The first example was `q1d`, the rest follow.


## Circular 1D geography

This is a twist on the earlier 1D geography where subpopulations and individuals are placed on a circumference, so random walks wrap around and the appropriate density is the Von Misses distribution.

Let's generate an analogous population structure to the original "linear" example.
```{r}
# reuse earlier (n,k) dimensions
n <- 100 # number of individuals
k <- 10 # number of intermediate subpops

# define population structure
F <- 1:k # subpopulation FST vector, up to a scalar
s <- 0.5 # desired bias coefficient
Fst <- 0.1 # desired FST for the admixed individuals
obj <- q1dc(n, k, s=s, F=F, Fst=Fst) # admixture proportions from *circular* 1D geography
Q <- obj$Q
F <- obj$F

# get pop structure parameters of the admixed individuals
Theta <- coanc(Q,F) # the coancestry matrix
# verify that we got the desired Fst!
fst(Q,F)

# verify that we got the desired s too!
mean(Theta)/Fst
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=1.2, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the per-subpopulation inbreeding coefficients (FSTs)
par(mar=c(2.5,2.5,0.3,0)+0.2, lab=c(2,1,7), mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0)) # tweak margins/etc
colIS <- brewer.pal(k, "Paired") # indep. subpop. colors
barplot(F, col=colIS, names.arg=colnames(Q), xlab='Subpopulation', ylab='Inbr')
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=1, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the admixture proportions
par(mar=c(1,4,0.4,0)+0.2, lab=c(2,2,7)) # tweak margins/etc
barplot(t(Q), col=colIS, border=NA, space=0, ylab='Admix prop')
mtext('Individuals', 1)
```

```{r, fig.width=3.1, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
# Visualize the coancestry matrix using "popkin"!
par(oma=c(0,1.5,0,3), mar=c(0,0,0.4,0)+0.2) # tweak margins/etc
plotPopkin(Theta, nPretty=3)
```



## Independent subpopulations

The independent subpopulations model, where individuals are actually unadmixed, is the most trivial form of the BN-PSD admixture model.

```{r}
# define population structure
# we'll have k=3 subpopulations, each with these sizes:
k <- 3
n1 <- 100; n2 <- 50; n3 <- 20
# here's the labels (for simplicity, list all individuals of S1 first, then S2, then S3)
labs <- c( rep.int('S1', n1), rep.int('S2', n2), rep.int('S3', n3) )
# data dimensions infered from labs:
length(labs) # number of individuals "n"
length(unique(labs)) # number of subpopulations "k"

# desired admixture matrix ("is" stands for "Independent Subpopulations")
Q <- qis(labs)
# got a boolean matrix with a single TRUE value per row
# (denoting the sole subpopulation from which each individual draws its ancestry)
head(Q, 2)

# construct the intermediate subpopulation FST vector
Fst <- 0.2 # the desired final FST
F <- 1:k # subpopulation FST vector, unnormalized so far
F <- F/popkin::fst(F)*Fst # normalized to have the desired Fst
popkin::fst(F) # verify FST for the intermediate subpopulations

# get coancestry of the admixed individuals
Theta <- coanc(Q,F) # the coancestry matrix
# before getting FST for individuals, weigh then inversely proportional to subpop sizes
w <- weightsSubpops(labs) # function from `popkin` package
# verify Fst for individuals (same as for intermediate subpops for this pop structure)
fst(Q, F, w)
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=1.2, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the per-subpopulation inbreeding coefficients (FSTs)
par(mar=c(2.5,2.5,0,0)+0.2, lab=c(2,1,7), mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0)) # tweak margins/etc
colIS <- brewer.pal(k, "Paired") # indep. subpop. colors
barplot(F, col=colIS, names.arg=colnames(Q), xlab='Subpopulation', ylab='Inbr')
```

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=1, fig.align='center'}
# visualize the admixture proportions
par(mar=c(1,4,0.4,0)+0.2, lab=c(2,2,7)) # tweak margins/etc
barplot(t(Q), col=colIS, border=NA, space=0, ylab='Admix prop')
mtext('Individuals', 1)
```

```{r, fig.width=3.1, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
# Visualize the coancestry matrix using "popkin"!
par(oma=c(0,1.5,0,3), mar=c(0,0,0.4,0)+0.2) # tweak margins/etc
plotPopkin(Theta, nPretty=3)
```
