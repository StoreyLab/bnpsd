Description: The Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) admixture model has k intermediate subpopulations from which n individuals draw their alleles dictated by their individual-specific admixture proportions.  The BN-PSD model additionally imposes the Balding-Nichols (BN) allele frequency model to the intermediate populations, which therefore evolved independently from a common ancestral population T with subpopulation-specific FST (Wright's fixation index) parameters.  The BN-PSD model can be used to yield complex population structures.  Method described in Ochoa and Storey (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009241>.
